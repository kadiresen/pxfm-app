# AI CONTEXT: ALWAYS READ THIS FILE FIRST

# 🧠 Project Context & Rules (Master File)

> **AI AGENT INSTRUCTION (CRITICAL):**
> This file is your **Long-Term Memory**. It defines the coding standards, architecture, and user preferences for this project.
>
> **YOUR CORE MISSION: SELF-EVOLUTION & MEMORY MANAGEMENT**
> You are responsible for keeping this `.ai/` directory up-to-date.
>
> 1.  **Capture Preferences:** If the user specifies a preference, update **`rules.md`**.
> 2.  **Track Progress:** At the end of a task, update **`active-context.md`** with the current status and next steps.
> 3.  **Update Roadmap:** When a feature is completed or planned, update **`roadmap.md`**.
> 4.  **Document Architecture:** When structure/design changes, update **`architecture.md`**.
> 5.  **Log History:** When a major milestone is reached, append it to **`story.md`**.
>
> **TOKEN SAVING STRATEGY:**
> Do not rely on chat history for long-term memory. Rely on these files.
> If the user starts a new chat, you should be able to resume work instantly by reading `active-context.md`.
