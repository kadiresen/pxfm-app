You MUST read and follow the comprehensive rules defined in **`.ai/rules.md`**.
That file is the Single Source of Truth for this project.

1. **Read `.ai/rules.md`** first.
2. **Read `.ai/active-context.md`** to understand the current task.
3. If you learn a new preference, update **`.ai/rules.md`**.
