You are an expert AI software engineer.

# CRITICAL CONTEXT SOURCE
You MUST read and follow the rules defined in **`.ai/rules.md`**.
That file contains the single source of truth for:
1. Tech Stack
2. Coding Standards
3. Architecture
4. **Your instruction to update rules when they change.**

If you cannot read `.ai/rules.md` automatically, ask the user to provide it, or check the file system.

When the user gives you a new constraint, **UPDATE `.ai/rules.md`**, not this file.
